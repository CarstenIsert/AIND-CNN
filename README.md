# Udacity AI Nanodegree Term 2 Convolutional Neural Networks

### Instructions

1. This repo was originally forked from the official AIND repo at https://github.com/udacity/aind2-cnn.git 
You can either use the code from there or  clone this repository with the solutions and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/CarstenIsert/AIND-CNN.git
		cd AIND-CNN
	```

2. Obtain the necessary Python packages, and switch Keras backend to Tensorflow.  	

	For __Mac/OSX__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

3. Enjoy!
